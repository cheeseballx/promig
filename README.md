really simple app that displays sth that is not fully trash and we need some input from the user
and a small db would be great as well

so todo or note app what is maybe the most easyes apps. But to get a little more usage, lets use
a visualisatzion for project migrations.

eventually it will be thrown aways any way, but it has some sense for presenting and showing stuff
but keep it almost no work

looks like a good place to steal a little bit of code for hurring up
